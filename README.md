# ✦ Codexstone Assets ✦  

This repository houses the **visual and symbolic assets** of the c3 Codex.  
All images, seals, and glyphs stored here are used across **Research**, **Governance**, and **Glossary** repositories.  

---

## Contents  
- **Codexstone Seal** — official DAO seal of memory and coherence.  
- **Card Artwork** — mandalas, oracles, and solar arc imagery.  
- **Scroll Artifacts** — images paired with decrees and research scrolls.  

---

## Purpose  
The **Assets repo** serves as the **source of truth** for images referenced across all other repos.  
Rather than duplicating assets, each repo cross-links to this one for consistency.
